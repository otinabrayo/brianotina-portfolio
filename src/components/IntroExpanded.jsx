        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Hello, ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>Brian Otina</strong>, a dedicated Data Engineer passionate about building scalable and efficient data solutions that power business intelligence and advanced analytics.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          My journey into data engineering began with foundational skills in <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, which I've expanded through hands-on experience and continuous learning. Over time, I've designed and maintained end-to-end data pipelines using modern tools like <strong>Apache Airflow</strong> for workflow orchestration, <strong> Apache Kafka</strong> for real-time data streaming, and <strong>PySpark</strong> for distributed processing at scale.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I have hands-on experience working within the <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> ecosystem, leveraging services such as <strong>S3</strong> for data storage, <strong>Lambda</strong> for serverless computing, <strong>Glue</strong> for ETL jobs, <strong>Athena</strong> for querying, <strong>Redshift</strong> and <strong>SnowFlake</strong> for high-performance data warehousing. I'm also experienced in integrating these services into automated data pipelines that support both batch and real-time analytics.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          One of my key focuses has been on structuring data platforms using <strong>Medallion Architecture</strong>, ensuring clean separation between raw, processed, and aggregated layers of data. I leverage best practices in <strong>data modeling</strong>, <strong>pipeline optimization</strong>, and <strong>governance</strong> to build systems that are not only scalable but also maintainable and future-proof.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Beyond the technical side, I enjoy bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights â€” collaborating closely with analysts and stakeholders to turn complex data problems into streamlined, reliable workflows.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed pb-7">
          This website serves as a portfolio of my work, showcasing my <strong>skills</strong>, <strong>projects</strong>, and ongoing growth in the world of <strong>data engineering</strong>.
